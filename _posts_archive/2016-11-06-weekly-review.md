How to get 30 designers?
- Upwork
- Personal connections
- Professionals at companies

## Changes on website
- Add country of origin or collect it automatically.
- Disallow taking the test on mobile.
- Build analysis page
  - Time taken over difference in rating.
  - Time for decision over decisions made.

## Can people recognize good design

#### Base study (needs 100 people for study)
  - Tournament graph
  - Trade-up graph
  - Use time to make decision to determine confidence
    - How many people+speed does it take to definitely say if one design is better.
  - Turn the comparisons into a 1 to 9 ranking and compare to LITW.
  - Graph time taken over difference in rating.
  - Graph time for decision over decisions made.


#### Expert study
  - Tournament
  - Trade-up
  - Ratings for 32 website images
  - Ratings for 32 same-content images


#### Add eye tracking
  - Does this provide additional evidence for a design being better or worse.


#### Additional game modes that change the shape of the curve.


#### Same Content w/ 32 variations 
- http://flyer.designcrowd.com/contest.aspx?id=1126697&page=11
- Trade-up Game w/ 16
- 1 to 9 ranking w/ 16?
- Maybe the algorithm from the base study will make it so we don't have to get the 1 to 9 rating.


#### 500ms task
