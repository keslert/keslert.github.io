## Exec Summary:
  
- Design study is online and functioning but I need to rethink Nasa TLX.
- Pilot studies are showing good results.
- Adobe Research Fellowship application is all ready except for your letter.

## Research

- I added the randoms selection you suggested for picking which images.
  - Q: Do you think I need to do something different for the training images?
- Added a cognitive load test after each study. From the pilots, I don't think it captures enough.


- Looked at Ranjitha's UIST papers
  - ERICA: Interaction Mining For Mobile Apps
  - The Elements of Fashion Style

- The Paradox of Choice
  - Self-efficacy decreases with too many choices
  - Need to limit the options

- Q: I wonder if as designs get better, it's harder to tell the better one. Meaning, does the different between design ratings need to get larger as designs get better? Or is it a static difference all the way from bad to good?
- Q: How does <strong>loss aversion</strong> factor in?
- Q: What do I need statistically to show difference between the two groups?
- Q: I wonder if a final page after doing both studies to ask questiona bout comparing and contrasting the two approaches would be best.

## Classes

Haven't done my CS 148 homework yet... that's today's project.

CS 347 is slowing down. Students are all working on their research projects for Wednesday's faire.

## Professional Development / Misc.

Learned a lot about Firebase this week. I'm really impressed with how easy they've made it to deploy a site.

One weeks to go until Jane's due date! This week she picked out a rocker chair and got it put together. She's trying to convince the baby that it's time to come and there's no need for him to wait another 7+ days.

This was a good week for my brother Drexler and his programming class. He's picking up the material and developing a better understanding for when to use things like loops, vectors, functions, etc... His class has helped me realize how programming is a whole lot of recognizing what tools solve what problems. You have to break down a bigger problem into smaller problems, but than you have to match your various tools to those problems. It was that pattern matching part that I hadn't really realized before.
