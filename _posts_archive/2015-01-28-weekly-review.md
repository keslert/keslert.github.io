## Research

##### Create Human Subjects Application

Much of my time went into brainstorming for this application. The application is only 90% done, but the exercise has caused me to make real progress on figuring out exactly what I want to accomplish this quarter. I would document my ideas here, but I feel like they are outlined pretty well in the application. 

I learned a few things about the Myo this week. First, it has a 2+ day battery life, so it's possible to do a field study in the future. Also, the accuracy of gestures greatly increases when you make a concerted effort to actually flex the muscles rather than just move the hand into position. I also mapped the predefined gestures to my own set of gestures (different finger taps) and I was relatively happy with the result. Each different finger tap could be picked up, although the accuracy was probably on 60%. The gesture to unlock the Myo is a double tap of the middle finger to the thumb though, so it makes me think that those taps of gestures are pretty easy to detect. Now that I figured out how to do the unlock gesture, I can perform it with 90% accuracy.

##### Papers I read

## Classes

ME 203 is in full swing. This week I spent a ton of time in mandatory labs learning how to weld and mill. Had to design my first part in SolidWorks which proved much more difficult than the tutorials we had previously done. It made me want to become more familiar with the tool. I also spent a day in Room 36 learning more about the laser cutter and printing prototypes for a checkers board.
