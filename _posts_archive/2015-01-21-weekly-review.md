  - Attended TEI
  - Caught up in ME 203
  - Came up with (3) concrete research ideas.

## Research

##### Read Scott’s NSF proposal

I found the report very helpful in understanding the vision for Scott’s original armband project. As I read the paper, I highlighted any of the ideas Scott had for output.

##### Create status report weekly - write it on a blog
  
Medium will have to suffice for this week, but I am close to having a blog up that I will use for publishing these in the future.

##### 3 Concrete Different Project Ideas

1. Always Available Interface: Use the Myo to pickup on hand gestures. Build a similar armband for output. The goal of this project would be to reduce the number of times someone glances at their phone for information. The user could query for the time, # of messages, # of emails, time until next calendar activity, etc…
2. Use the vibration band to help users better judge the passing of time. An example of this would be to help speakers know how long they have been speaking. 
3. Controlled breathing exercises, using the band to set the pace of breathing. This could help with training, sleeping, etc…

###### Next Week

  - Progress on what I’d planned to do. (papers and summary)
  - Details
  - Plan for next week.

## Classes

I officially got into ME 203. This class has demanded a crazy amount of time this week. Yesterday I had 8 hours of class/lab time for it and the TA’s estimated at least another 20 hours of lab work in the next week. I’m still glad that I’m in the course, however, as I’m enjoying learning the material and I think it will be really helpful in rapidly prototyping projects in the future.

## Professional Development / Service 

In addition to ME 203, a lot of my time Friday through Monday went to attending the TEI conference. This was my first academic conference and it was really helpful to my understanding to attend. 

My favorite papers were the following:

* Designing the Unexpected: Endlessly Fascinating Interaction for Interactive Installations
* MagnID: Tracking multiple magnetic tokens
* SPATA: spatio-tangible tools for fabrication aware design

I realized that research comes in a lot of different shapes and sizes. I am much more interested in the building of systems than theory.
