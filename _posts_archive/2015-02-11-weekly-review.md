## Exec Summary:
  - Brainstormed possible applications 
  - Built a functioning vibration wristband
  - Michelle had zero luck with the Myo. I researched other possibilities.

## Research

#### Finished a rough prototype of the vibration band

As much as I hate to admit it, my initial testings of mapping vibration to the clock were not as flawless as I hoped... It was easy to tell vibrations moving clockwise, but moving counter-clockwise caused issues. Overtime sensitivity to the different sensors decreased. I'd like continue playing with the frequency of which the vibrations occur.

I think that vibrations affect too broad of an area on the arm. Maybe I could turn the vibration intensity down.

#### Top applications for

 - Always Available Interfaces
    - Treadmill
    - Personal habit tracking
 - Discrete Gestures
    - Timers
 - Eyes-free interface
    - Waiter assistance

#### Kathryn McElroy's research

I found Kathryn's research very interesting. She "explores approaches to limiting the distraction caused by modern information technology."

#### Lookup vibration / clock paper.

I asked Jessica about this paper, and she couldn't remember anything about it. She said she would look for it, but hasn't found it yet.

#### Met with Frank Bentley
  
I attended Frank's presentation and afterwards met with him for 30 minutes to discuss his research. He didn't have any details on how many times someone turned they phone on without proceeding past the lock screen. He said he could probably get the numbers from his data though. Those are the types of events that I think we could replace with vibration. 

He mentioned a student in Bolivia that tapped his phone three times to get a vibration for the minutes until the next bus arrived. It used the location data of the phone.

#### Researched alternative hand gesture detection methods.

  - wrist-worn 3D infrared cameras
  - Accelerometer, gyro sensors
  - Gloves / Rings
  - EMG (Myo)
  - Bio-acoustic methods
  - Photodiodes and infrared LEDs around the wrist to infer gestures from infrared reflectance
  - Capacitance and acceleration sensors. Measures the changes of the arm shape on the inside of the wrist-band. See GestureWrist for more details
  - **Force Sensitive Resistors (FSRs) [this looks like the best option]**

These are the papers I read this week:

  - Adventures in Tactile Literacy
  - Ambient Touch: Designing Tactile Interfaces for Handheld Devices
  - Skin Drag Displays: Dragging a Physical Tactor across the Userâ€™s Skin Produces a Stronger Tactile Stimulus than Vibrotactile 

#### Next Week

  - Myo is kind of out.... a lot depends on the direction we choose to move forward.

## Classes

Still enjoying ME 203. We are now working fulltime on our projects. I spent time in the lab turning aluminum on the lathe and then cutting internal grooves on the mill. Progress is slow go but enjoyable.
