  - Familiarized myself with UIST.
  - Read a bunch of papers on haptics.
  - Finished ME 103D.

## Research

##### Met with Kat and Michelle.

I met with Kat and she seems smart and interested in getting some research experience. It looks like she will mostly work with Jessica. I also met with Michelle. She is a freshman but seems extremely motivated and capable. My take on her though is that she is currently interested in the virtual/augmented reality movement. This week she is going to do some work with the Myo and try to get it to recognize a set of 4 discrete gestures. She actually didn't have any experience with gestures. She was on a team that did something with the Myo, but they just used the accelerometer.

##### Familiarized myself with UIST
  
Jessica asked me to become more familiar with UIST and the types of papers that are being accepted. I was surprised to see that there were quite a few papers that didn't do user studies. I had thought that was pretty much a requirement for this type of research. I learned that papers don't have a particular length, but the length is supposed to match the size of the contribution. Lastly, I learned that there are lots of people that were working on novel input methods, but there weren't really any output papers at UIST in 2014.

##### Read a bunch of papers on haptics.

Jessica feels strongly that we need to find a better method of output than vibration. I've been doing a lot of research to try and figure out the current research on vibration as output as well as anything else that people are using. There's plenty of researchin on input and output, but not much on them together.

These are the papers I read this week:

  - The Sound of Touch: On-body Touch and Gesture Sensing Based on Transdermal Ultrasound Propagation
  - WristFlex: Low-Power Gesture Input with Wrist-Worn Pressure Sensors
  - LightRing: Always-Available 2D Input on Any Surface 
  - HaptoMime: Mid-Air Haptic Interaction with a Floating Virtual Screen
  - Vibkinesis: Notification by Direct Tap and ‘Dying Message’ Using Vibronic Movement Controllable Smartphones
  - Haptic-Emoticon: Haptic Content Creation and Sharing System To Enhancing Text-Based Communication
  - ActiveClick: Tactile Feedback for Touch Panels

The last paper used a method for vibration that I don't quite understand but it sounded promising. 

##### Next Week

  - Decide on whether or not the Myo is going to work. This will be highly depenedent on Michelle's findings.
  - Figure out 3 concrete discrete outputs that we could legitimtely use.

## Classes

Finished my magnifying glass and bronze plaque for ME 203. Pictures below are not mine, but they look exactly like them.

I also finished my ME 103D SolidWorks class. ME 203 will now consist of working on my final project which is a checkers set.
