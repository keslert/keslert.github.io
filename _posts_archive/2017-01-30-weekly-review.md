## Research

Submitted the video for the HDPTRP workshop.

Data crunching w/ Rob. His working space is top-notch. It reminded me of a hip new startup location. Somewhat of an open floor plan. Encouraged collaboration. While working on the data we were assisted by 3 additional researchers.

Takeaways
- People can recognize good design (confirmed by our study and Reinecke's data)
- Experts are not significantly different than novices when you account for the self. I think we need a better "expert" classifier before we can say anything about this. But... these people did answer "Yes" to the question, "Do you or have you worked as a design professional?"

Learned a lot about rStudio and thinking statistically.



## Classes

Continuing to work my way through Designing, Running, and Analyzing Experiments. We are building up to the statistics that Rob helped me use. Hopefully when I get there, everything will make more sense.

## Professional Development / Misc.

Making progress on the HCI web site. Ali has started to help me with getting it ready to launch.

Learned how to use Styled Components and used them in Hey Habit.

Learned more about building a Chrome extension.

Attended a great Chinese New Year's party.
