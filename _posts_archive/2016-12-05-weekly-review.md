## Research

#### Website Alexa Rankings

Unfortunately, even though Reinecke makes the images available that she used, she didn't provide a list of the urls for them. From a quick inspection, it looked like a large portion of them could be figured out by looking at the image. I've hired a freelancer on Upwork that was supposed to have completed this already, but he's still working on it.
- Hired a freelancer on Upwork
- Remove websites in the top 100?
- Show ranking for every website in the original data set

#### StudyOfDesign.com

Last week when I said "advertise on Facebook" I think we both took that to mean different things. I meant to run a "pay-per-click" style ad to drive traffic to the website and from Friday's meeting, I think you thought I meant just posting on our accounts. Because I was solving for the first problem, I made the site look more professional to encourage participation.

#### Additional Studies

I've been working on two additional studies. The first is the study we want design professionals to take. It will include 4 parts: trade-up study, tournament study, ranking websites on a scale from 1-9, ranking same content on a scale from 1-9.

The second study is a timed version of the trade-up and tournament studies that only allows the participant to view the design for X milliseconds. Again, I was working on this because I wanted to capitalize on the traffic we would be driving to the website and perhaps get people to take both studies.

#### General improvements
- Added code to get tell which mode they did first
- Added clarification on the results page
- Added chart to analysis page showing participants final image position
- Added chart to analysis page showing time taken by each participant

#### James Questions
- Q: For the expert survey, is there any reason not to just have an open answer for the question, why do you consider yourself a design professional?
- Q: Are there issues with using the same set of 360 websites for the speed test study?
- Q: Let's discuss specifics for the speed test.
- Q: For the expert's 1 to 9 rating, can we just pick a smaller set of websites? 
- Q: Let's discuss specifics for the expert test.
- Q: Right now I'm NOT allowing mobile. Is it worth the increase in #'s to make it work?

#### Research Questions
- Q: On averge how long is one website held
- Q: Is there statistical significance between a decision made after holding a website for 5 times vs a brand new decision
- Q: What does a really bad participant look like?

## Professional Development / Misc.

Spending lots of time learning how to be a dad. Fenton eats really well and sleeps decently, so that's been a blessing.

Slowly going through Machine Learning class on Coursera.

I attended the Adobe retreat. Had a nice chat with Matt Fisher. They're working on a problem and need to know how to rank/filter generated designs.

Recently at church I was asked to help my Bishop keep church callings organized. As such, I've been attending more meetings on Sunday's and Wednesday's to help out with that. It's been interesting to see more of what it takes to manage an LDS ward. It blows my mind how generous some people are with their time. Some callings require an extensive amount of time and yet people are still willing to serve.

Watched the Christmas Devotional that's broadcast by the LDS church every year.

Listened to a book about Howard Hughes and started The Help.
