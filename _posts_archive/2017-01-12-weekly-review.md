## Exec Summary:
  

- HPDTRP
  - Background & Proposal
    - Create design tools for novice designers
      - Novice designers don't know how to do design
      - Novice designers can recognize good design
      - If so and we can suggest designs they can pick the good ones
      
      - As an example here's a tool that we created first to see what this concept might be like.
        - Show it

      - Taking a step back... test our assumptions before creating a tool
        - First step is to see if people can actually recognize good design
      - Show the Survey tool with website 
      - Talk about some of the results

      - Next steps going forward
        - Using the results of our first tool to inform our next system

Write out 3 challenges or obstacles you are facing, or questions you would like to explore regarding approach, direction, etc of your research.
- We used a design scale from Reinecke, is there a better validated design scale we should be exploring.
- Does this hold true for your own designs, or does designer ego bias get in the way?
- If you can't distinguish incremental improvements, how does a design tool make suggestions?
- TODO: Issue around mining data and how it fits with what we are doing.


# Rename Trade & Tournament
- Keep-the-Best
- Tournament Bracket

# Conclusion
- The average person can recognize good design almost as well as an expert.
- Ground truth based on aggregate novice ratings is supported by novice and experts alike. 

# Experts vs Novices
- Novices are slightly slower than experts.
- Novices make more mistakes
- Experts can distinguish at a smaller granulartiy

# The way the comparison is presented affects performance
- Trade results in fewer mistakes, (is this simply because more decisions are further apart?)
- People can decide quicker in trade,
- People on average end up with a better design in trade (Is this only because of outliers?)

## Research

Met with David Karger
- "I know it when I see it" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio

The role of comparison in preschoolers' novel object categorization
- "That is, the act of examining two or more things in conjunction allows children to assess commonalities and differences that do not involve highly salient features."
- "Second, our findings demonstrate that the comparison process was more pronounced when the objects were labeled with a shared name."


Making a Silk Purse Out of Two Sow’s Ears: Young Children’s Use of Comparison in Category Learning
- "Students who compared the two stories and wrote out the commonalitiesbetween them were far more likely to solve the later problem than those who simply read one story. Similarly, Loewenstein, Thompson, and Gentner (1999) documented that business school students who engaged in explicit comparison of two negotiation scenarios were more apt to apply appropriate negotiation strategies in real world situations than were those who studied the same two scenacios without explicitly comparing them."


Played with the WIX ADI Builder. It's beyond bad... horrible experience. Takes 45 seconds to do anything.
