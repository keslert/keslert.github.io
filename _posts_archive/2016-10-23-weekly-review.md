## Research

Online Survey
- 32 images from 16 buckets.
- Tournament Mode and Trade Up.
- Measuring time taken and times hovered.

Random questions?
- Can you use remorse to your advantage?
- Some people feel pressure to trade in the trade-up game. How do you alleviate that pressure?
- Is it possible that time taken to assess two images could determine how close their scores are? Maybe this helps split up the middle designs better?
- What does P1's Graph look like?
- Why are likert scales odd?


Why is comparing better?
- By comparing designs people are able to more accurately compare
- Rating things by comparing is an easier task and more satisfying task than absolute ratings of individual design.
  - One more accurate
  - Cognitive load
- It's more accurate about the absolute ratings
- It's more accurate about the orderings
- More accurate about quartiles
- Easier, more satisfying, cognitive load (NASA TLX)
- Faster (each individual decision)
- Designs in the middle take longer to judge? (Designs within 2.0 of each other take longer.)

## Classes

CS 148's assignment this week has been difficult. I need to spend a good chunk of my day today finishing it before 7pm.

CS 347: Michael was gone this week so Wendy Ju and Jeff Hancock came and presented. This class should slow down after today.

## Professional Development / Misc.

Learned how to have a navigation bar in the page that snaps to the top as you go past it.

More baby prep. Two weeks to go! Got the car seat installed.

Celebrated Jane's birthday this week. We went to breakfast at Stack's and then went to the 10am showing of Sully in Mountain View. Movie was really good. 

Spent several hours this week helping my brother Drexler with his programming class. It was all about functions and arrays this week. I really wish we didn't teach beginning programmers C++.
