## Exec Summary:
  
- Expert Survey
- Design Scale
- Updated the timeline
- Brainstorm what tool to build?
  - Adobe Spark
  - http://launchaco.com/build/
  - http://launchaco.com/
  - http://logojoy.com

## Research

#### Tool to build
I really like the direction these two websites have taken with design:
- http://launchaco.com/build/
- http://logojoy.com

Novices seem very excited about these tools (experts not so much). I think there are good things here, but I'd like to take them further and make the feedback loops more intelligent. Also, I'm thinking web over presentations.

#### Timeline and Deliverables

###### December 2016 
  - Finish Novice & Expert Surveys 

###### January 2017 
  - Submit to DIS 2017. Deadlines Jan. 9th,16th.
  - Finish Speed Survey (How quickly can people accurately compare designs?)

###### February 2017
  - HPDTRP Meetup
  - Finish Similar Content Survey (When the content is the same, what happens?)
###### March - May 2017
  - Build Website Automation Tool

###### June 2017
  - Run test to determine if a perceptions ability to recognize design is tied to their ability to create good design with traditional tools.

###### Septemer 2017
  - Submit Tool & Evaulation paper to CHI. Deadlines Sep. 14th,21st.
  - Submit Survey 2.0 paper to CHI


#### Internship Summer/Fall?
I'd like to stay local here this summer since I have the grant to cover summer. But... I'm interested in doing an internship at Adobe, Google or MSR in the fall.

###### Adobe
- Joel Brandt: build tools that support creative work

###### Google
- Jeffrey Nichols: intelligent user interfaces and context-aware computing [Deadline Jan 13th]
  - mining UI design patterns and compiling datasets for potential computational design applications. 
  - designing and generalizing examples of good assistant-style experiences with the goal of compiling them into a patterns library and guidelines for designers and developers
  - exploring task-oriented recommender systems


#### Expert Study
- 1 to 9 for all 360 websites on 64 ratings 
- Trade-up
- Tournament


#### Novice Analysis
What's the difference in rating from someone's top choice and the actual top choice

For people who did "poorly":
- Was it a single bad mistake
- Or was it a string of bad decisions

## Study 1.5 Time Trials

## Study 2

Positive correlation between recognizing good design and creating good design
- If we can help ou better recognize design, you'll be a better designer

Negative or null correlation
- Change tools so they rely more on your ability to recognize good design rather than create it


Potentially Game Improvements
- Embedding education as to why a design is better

## Classes

Working on the final image for CS 148. Still needs a lot of work. It's difficult because the feedback loop is 6+ seconds and it's hard to reason about.

## Professional Development / Misc.

Attended a Christmas sing-a-long with friends. 

Hosted a Hot Cocoa bar with friends on Sunday.
