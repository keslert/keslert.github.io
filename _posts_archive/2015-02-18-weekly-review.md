## Research

#### Progress on the Myo with Michelle

The Myo worked really well this week. I'm not sure why Michelle didn't have any luck with it before, but when I sat down with her and walked through the steps, it worked really well. In fact, it worked better for her than it did for me. It's possible that her Myo gives better readings as she's been able to upgrade to the latest firmware.

We looked through the iOS SDK together and it should be pretty easy to get the gestures we want. We will still have to use the custom profile to move from the default gestures to our set of discrete gestures, but we had pretty good luck with those so far. Michelle is working on a sample iOS app and hopes to have it done by Thursday (she has a hackethon this weekend).

After this week's meeting I have a better feel for working with Michelle. I'll be interested to see how she does with the coding.

You should have access to the above document. It's still a little rough, but definite progress.

## Classes

Working on the checkers set for ME 203. Spending lots of time in the labs... I should have some of my pieces with me for our meeting for a little show-and-tell.

## Professional Development / Service 

 - Took a weekend trip to Carmel and Big Sur. Jane and I have wanted to get out and see more of California and the long weekend gave us a good excuse.
 - I was a home teacher for a man named Ambrosio Gorospe who passed away this week. His wife asked me to give a closing prayer at his funeral.
 - Continued my migration from Bluehost to Digital Ocean. Learned some good things about nginx.
