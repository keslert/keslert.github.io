## Exec Summary:

- IRB approved
- 76 responses (60 experts, 17 novices)
- Finished HCI Statistics Coursera course
- Progress on Variation 2.0
- Mozilla?

- Questions
  - What should we filter an "expert" by?
  - Can I combine the data from the two studies?

## Research

I have a few more surveys ready to go. Judging flyers is more difficult than websites... maybe because it's more about the details?

I got approval late last week from IRB, so I can move whenver now on those surveys.

There are 76 responses to the expert survey. I just finished the Coursera HCI stats course and feel semi-comfortable doing an analysis on the data now.

I've spent most of my time working on Variation 2.0. I'm really happy with my progress and think I've made some good discoveries along the way.

Ranked CURIS students. Hopefully, the matchmaking will work out well...

## Classes

Finished HCI Stats Coursera course.

## Professional Development / Misc.

Purchased a 4'x6' whiteboard off of Craigslist. It's nice!

- We used a design scale from Reinecke, is there a better validated design scale we should be exploring.
- Does this hold true for your own designs, or does designer ego bias get in the way?
  - TODO: 
- If you can't distinguish incremental improvements, how does a design tool make suggestions?
  - Radical changes
