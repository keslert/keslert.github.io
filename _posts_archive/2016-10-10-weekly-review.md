## Exec Summary:
  - Trade Up game study. I'm really excited about this idea. I think it extends current research quite nicely and will inform the design of a future tool. **I'd like to spend the majority of our meeting solidying/brainstorming this idea**.
  - Can submit to LabInTheWild, but it appears to be a slow go process. I think it would be better to do smaller, preliminary studies first.
  - CS 376 finalizing students and grading. Students entering and exiting the class is a PAIN due to how quickly we get started with the course.

## Research

##### Questions I want to answer
- Can users recognize good design?
  - As judged by whom? Professionals?
  - Does this change when judging variations on the same design?
    - What kinds of changes work?
      - Global vs Local
- Is 1 to 9 the best scale?
  - "Hit the spacebar when a design is > 5"
  - "Hit the spacebar when a design is < 5"
  - Judge if the new design is better than the current best
    - Same, Better, Worse than the current design
  - 1 to 4 scale. (no middle ground. design is really good, good, bad, really bad)
  - By doing the tradeup game, can people always end up with a design that is in the top 80%?
    - Can they do this even if they only see the design for 500ms?
    - What if there are only mediocre designs at the top? Do you have to have really great designs to get past the middle designs?
    - In the tradeup game, are you always trading up? How often do people go backwards?

##### Lab in the wild

  - 500ms was fast for judging a design.
  - Takes 1-4 weeks to get approved.
  - Needs to provide some incentive to users. Usually in the form of comparing them to other people.
  - Able to use their data to generate this chart. I think we can use their same images to run a portion of our study.
  - ![Reinecke14 Avg Ratings United States](/assets/img/posts/reinecke_avg.png)

##### Evaluating the consistency of immediate aesthetic perceptions of web pages
  - Response latency. Average aesthetics take longer to judge than very good or very poor.
  - Classic Aesthetics = orderliness and clarity of the design. (clean, pleasant, aesthetic)
  - Expressive aesthetics = originality, creativity and the richness of the design. (sophisticated, creative, fascinating)

##### Measuring Utility of Human-Computer Interaction

##### Read some Recommendation System papers.

## Classes

CS 376 is going well, but it's busy. This week will be busy with it as well because groups are submitting their project brainstorming ideas.

CS 148 is also going well and continues to be interesting. This week was learning how to use vertex and fragment shaders. Took me back to my Amazon days.

## Professional Development / Misc.

My brother, Drexler, is currently taking an Introduction to Programming course at BYU. He had midterms coming up this week, so we spent a lot of time reviewing concepts that hadn't quite clicked for him. Going through this course with him has been an interesting exercise to learn what concepts are difficult for new learners. It's often the simple concepts that trip him up such as that programs execute line by line.
