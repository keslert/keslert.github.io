  - Made good progress on iOS / Myo programming

## Research

#### Modified and resubmitted IRB protocol

This took a ton of time, but we feel pretty good about the resubmitted protocol. The resubmitted protocol includes both the base user study and the treadmill application. Jessica doesn't think we will hear back about it until the IRB meeting. 

We were also able confirm with Tressidor Fitness Center that we can use one of their treadmills for our user study. If we want to use non-Stanford affiliated partipants we would need further approval. They also said that we were fine to film in their gym.

#### Connect iOS app to Myo

Made really good progress this week with the actual Myo programming. Michelle is doing much better with a little more structure. She seemed excited about figuring out getting the Myo and Pebble to communicate.

It looks like it is going to be difficult to use custom gestures. For now, we are moving forward with the default ones. We figured out how to connect multiple Myo's to the same iOS app as well.

Using the Myo SDK we're able to send short, medium and long vibrations. These would be suitable for the patterns we want to send. Unfortunately, the vibrations didn't seem to be strong enough. My intuition is that we should just use the Pebbles since we're confident from Jessica's research that it will work.

#### Set goals and started calendar for first user studies

We want to do three pilot studies by next Tuesday and Wednesday. Most likely Lydia, Jane E and Jane Tanner.

Really enjoying ME203. This week I finished all 12 of my exterior rings. I need to have a prototype that shows functionality by Thursday.

## Professional Development / Service 

 - Hosted a geneological research night at our house. Found an old death record online for one of my ancestors that I didn't have in the system. It was for a Paul Alfred Yax that died when he was only four months old. Thirteen years later the family had another boy whom they also named Paul.
