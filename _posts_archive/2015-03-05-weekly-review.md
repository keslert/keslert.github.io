## Research

#### GestVibe

90% of the coding is completed for GestVibe. There will be a little bit more depending on how the pilot studies go and what we want to do for the watch interface and smartphone app. Things are working remarkably well.

Wednesday Jessica and I will practice the basic study and the study on the treadmill. I will run the study on Thursday with Michelle. Friday we'll try it with Lydia or Jane T. 

#### Next quarter rotations

I sent emails to Sean Follmer and Phil Levis. Sean has to talk with Michael about the logistics, but I will have a phone call with him later this week. I'll be meeting with Phil sometime next week.

Final project for ME203 has to basically be done by Monday. Wednesday morning I drill holes for all of the pins and then Thursday I cut out the last of the pieces.

## Professional Development / Service 

 - Made some more great progress on geneology.
 - Learned a good deal about developing for the Pebble. My knowledge of Bluetooth in general has grown a lot in the past few weeks.
