  thoughts: Covers the history of innovation and how it is brought about. A key takeaway is that innovation doesn't come from someone sitting in their lab thinking about a problem. Instead it comes from the collision of ideas that come when people interact with each other. Those collisions spark new ideas that people then apply to problems that they are familiar with (that's where the time in the lab is actually useful). I thought that was a really good insight and that has inspired me to continue "colliding" with the world around me.

Eventually I will have a finished app, but until then, I'll enjoy the learning. I've also been encouraged to start practicing new skills. I've started doing graphic design again, something I've always admired in others.
