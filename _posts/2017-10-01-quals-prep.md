#### The Design of Everyday Things
Physical Affordances — the screen looks touchable
Signifiers — Guiding the user to know where to touch on the screen
Conceptual Model — Perception of how something works

7 Stages of Action
1. Goal
2. Plan
3. Specify
4. Perform
5. Perceive
6. Interpret
7. Compare

Three Levels of Processing
1. Visceral
2. Behavioral
3. Reflective

Short Term Memory
Long Term Memory

Knowledge in the World
Knowledge in the Head

Human-Centered Design

#### The Media Equation

Individual's interactions with computers, television, and new media are fundamentally social and naturally, just like interactions in real life.

The automatic response is to accept what seems to be real as in fact real.

1. Improving the Design of Media
2. Evaluating Media
3. New Methods for Research
4. Big Issues

When media conforms to social and natural rules, no extra instruction is necessary.

Grice's Maxims for Politeness
1. Quality—speakers should say things that are true
2. Quantity—not too much and not too little
3. Relevance
4. Clarity

People are polite to people. They are also subconciously polite to media. Many will not admit it. It doesn't normally happen on the conscious level.

#### The Reflective Practitioner

Technical Rationality.

"Professional" requires a set of generalized solutions for solving set problems. In the real world, problems are rarely this clean. Instead problems are messy.

Each new problem should be approached as unique. Try to find a frame that makes sense and we can map one of our previous solutions onto it.


#### Distance Matters

1. Common Ground
2. Coupling of work
3. Collaborative readiness
4. Technological readiness

Technology may not be able to solve differences in common ground, timezone, and culture.

* Copresence — same physical environment
* Visibility - visible to teach other
* Audibility — speech
* Contemporality — message received immediately
* Simultaneity — both speakers can send and receive
* Sequentiality — turns cannot get out of sequence
* Reviewability — able to review other's messages
* Revisability — can revise messages before they are sent

#### Beyond Being There

Are we building crutches or shoes? Crutches are made for improving a bad situation. We don't use them once we are better. Shoes augment and improve our abilities. 

A technology succeeds in "beyond being there" when we use it even when physical face-to-face communication is possible. One example is email.
