#### The Design of Everyday Things
Physical Affordances — the screen looks touchable
Signifiers — Guiding the user to know where to touch on the screen
Conceptual Model — Perception of how something works

7 Stages of Action
1. Goal
2. Plan
3. Specify
4. Perform
5. Perceive
6. Interpret
7. Compare

Three Levels of Processing
1. Visceral
2. Behavioral
3. Reflective

Short Term Memory
Long Term Memory

Knowledge in the World
Knowledge in the Head

Human-Centered Design

#### The Media Equation

Individual's interactions with computers, television, and new media are fundamentally social and naturally, just like interactions in real life.

The automatic response is to accept what seems to be real as in fact real.

1. Improving the Design of Media
2. Evaluating Media
3. New Methods for Research
4. Big Issues

When media conforms to social and natural rules, no extra instruction is necessary.

Grice's Maxims for Politeness
1. Quality—speakers should say things that are true
2. Quantity—not too much and not too little
3. Relevance
4. Clarity

People are polite to people. They are also subconciously polite to media. Many will not admit it. It doesn't normally happen on the conscious level.

#### The Reflective Practitioner

Technical Rationality vs Reflection-in-action

"Professional" requires a set of generalized solutions for solving set problems. In the real world, problems are rarely this clean. Instead problems are messy.

Each new problem should be approached as unique. Try to find a frame that makes sense and we can map one of our previous solutions onto it.

Developing a toolkit of solutions. Framing problems. Mapping solutions onto that framing.

* Can I solve the problem I have set?\
* Do I like what I get when I solve this problem?
* Have I made the situation coherent?
* Have I made it congruent with my fundamental values and theories?
* Have I kept inquiry moving?

"Scientists and engineers learn to model unfamiliar problems on familiar ones and build new theory by reflecting on perceived but as yet unarticulated similarities."

Dillema of the professional today is the rapid change in "the body of knowledge that he must use and the expectations of the society that he must serve".

"Langdell claimed law was science... this meant that its principles could be developed from analysis of prior court decisions and could be used to predict subsequent ones."

"Production of new scientific knowledge could be used to create wealth, achieve national goals, improve human life, and solve social problems.

"Shall the practitioner stay on the high, hard ground where he can practice rigorously, as he understands rigor, but where he is constrained to deal with problems of relatively little social importance? Or shall he descend to the swamp where he can engage the most important and challenging problems if he is willing to forsake technical rigor?"


#### Distance Matters

1. Common Ground
2. Coupling of work
3. Collaborative readiness
4. Technological readiness

Technology may not be able to solve differences in common ground, timezone, and culture.

* Copresence — same physical environment
* Visibility - visible to teach other
* Audibility — speech
* Contemporality — message received immediately
* Simultaneity — both speakers can send and receive
* Sequentiality — turns cannot get out of sequence
* Reviewability — able to review other's messages
* Revisability — can revise messages before they are sent

#### Beyond Being There

Are we building crutches or shoes? Crutches are made for improving a bad situation. We don't use them once we are better. Shoes augment and improve our abilities. 

A technology succeeds in "beyond being there" when we use it even when physical face-to-face communication is possible. One example is email.

Asyncronous, Anonymous, Archived

#### Tangible Bits

Interactive Surfaces — metaDESK
Coupling of bits with Graspable Physical Objects — transBOARD
Ambient Media for Background Awareness — ambientROOM

#### A Pattern Language

##### 1. Independent Regions

Small and autonomous. 2 to 10 million

1. Nature and limits of human government. (N^2 number of relations)
2. Equity among regions in a world community. (large enough to have a voice)
3. Regional planning consideration. (solve their own environmental problems)
4. Support for the intensity and diversity of human cultures. 



##### 2. Distribution of Towns

2 arguments
1. Economic
Over populated cities result in richer cities but poorer rural areas.
2. Ecological
Polution, strangled transportation, water shortages, housing shortages, living densities.

* Towns of 1,000,000 — 250 miles apart
* Towns of 100,000 — 80 miles apart
* Towns of 10,000 — 25 miles apart
* Towns of 1,000 — 8 miles apart


##### 3. City Country Fingers

Urban and rural areas should intertwine like fingertips with farmland strips being no smaller than 1-mile wide and urban strips being no wider than 1-mile wide. This allows for any citizen to be in the country in a short 10-minute walk.

People can go crazy in cities. If the countryside is too far away, it can clog up streets on weekends when people are trying to travel outside the city.

##### 4. Agricultural Valleys

Farmlands need to be built in the fertile valleys. Houses can be built on hilltops and hillsides.

##### 5. Lace of Country Streets

Leave at least a half acre open behind houses and only stack them 1 or 2 deep. This allows you to have a road running through all of the houses, their being spaced close together, but enough farm ground behind their houses. These can even turn into communal farm ground. Country roads should be spaced no closer than 1-mile apart. The goal for these roads is not to maximize efficiency, it's to maintain open space.

##### 78. A house for one person

The trick is to intesnfiy and to overlay; compress patterns; to make every inch count double. Large and small alcoves. Needs its own garden, no matter how small.

##### 89. Corner Grocery

Neighborhood stores are one of the two most important elements in people's perception of an area as a neighborhood. They are a generator of walks. To be considered walking distance, the store needs to be within 3 blocks or 1200 feet.

##### 104. Site repair

People often build on the most beautiful land. In the process, they destory part of the beauty and less beautiful land continues to be neglected rather than cultivated. Forego human nature, leave the most beautiful land as it lies and cultivate the other.

##### 130. Entrance Room

1. Windows. People want to see who is coming.
2. The need for shelter outside the door.
3. The subtleties of saying goodbye.
4. Waist-high shelf near the entrance for temporarily holding packages so your hands are free.
5. The entrance room should not provide visibility to the rest of the house.
6. Coats, shoes and children's bikes.

##### 170. Fruit trees

Magical identity, seasonal changes for the threes. Local common land, people can work together to harvest the results. Not a lot of work, usually only harvesting and pruning. Can bring great satisfaction to a community to harvest its own fruit.

##### 179. Alcoves

Should be large enough for 1 to 2 people. Separate and secluded, but still communal. People want to be together, but at the same time they want the opportunity for some small amount of privacy, without giving up community.

##### 181. The Fire

Build the fire in a common space.
Draw people together and provide a counterpoint to conversation. Make space where people can sit in front of the fire that doesn't interfere with normal paths.

##### 185. Sitting Circle

People like to sit at an angle to each other, not side by side. The circle should not be perfect and people should feel comfortable enough to adjust the layout

##### 190. Ceiling Height Variety

Low ceilings make for intimacy, high ceilings for formality. 

* Theory 1: Ceiling height should be related to the length and breadth of the room. 
* Theory 2: Ceiling height is related to social distance between people in the room.
* Theory 3: It is not the absolute height that matters, but the variety itself.

Build storage between floors and ceiling where you want to lower ceiling heights.
Put alcoves over each other.
Raise the floor level with steps.

##### 203. Child Caves

Children like to play in caves. Under stairs, under kitchen counters, use natural left over spaces.


### Design Galleries

1. Input Vector
2. Mapping
3. Output Vector
4. Distance metric

### Webzeitgeist

Stored the bounding box of every DOM element.

### Gestures without Libraries: A $1 Recognizer

1. Resample the Point Path (each path should have N points)
2. Rotate once based on the "indicative angle" (starting point to center of mass)
3. Scale and Translate (non-uniformly)
4. Find the optimal angle (optional)

Stats provided sound very much like Wobbrock
Best performance was gestures at medium speed. Compared against two other known algorithms.
Probably should have also tested the reverse Tn to T0 in case people did the gesture in reverse.

### Crayons: camera-based interaction

Creating classifiers by marking pixels with different colors to signify what class they belong in. 150+ features for each pixel. The trained classifier is exported as a serialized Java object.

### Designing the Whyline: A Debugging Interface

Interrogative debugging.

Why did... Why didn't... 

Most questions are Why didn't questions.

Difficult to do in the real world because need to hold the whole system and history in memory.

### SUPPLE: Automatically Generating User Interfaces

Treats UI design as an optimization problem with three inputs: an interface specification, a device model, and a user model.

1. Formally define interface rendering problem as an optimization problem
2. User specific renderings
3. Efficient branch and bound rendering algorithm (implemented as SUPPLE)
4. Experiments showing speed of SUPPLE, quality of resulting interfaces and SUPPLE's ability to customize for individual users.

### Automation and Customization of Rendered Web Pages

Chickenfoot. Made for programmers that don't know HTML, but do know Javascript? Needs root permissions in order to embed content from other websites. 

Keyword Pattern Matching Algorithm uses pixel distance between label and element, and distance in the document tree between the two elements. The label is also scored by fuzzy comparison to allow for spelling errors. 

### Prefab: Implementing Advanced Behaviors Using Pixel-Based Reverse Engineering of Interface Structure

Reverse engineer the pixel representation of an interface to overlay a new interface on top of it that provides additional functionality such as Bubble selection, Sticky Inputs

### Human-Machine Reconfigurations

Plan (vs) Situated Action

http://mcs.open.ac.uk/yr258/sit_act/

Situationed Action = "people's actions are influenced by the context of their specific situation" or as defined by Lucy Suchman "every course of action is highly dependent upon its material and social circumstances focusing on moment-by-moment interactions between actors, and between actors and the environments of their action"

Human-machine interactions. How do we understand actions and interactions to support AI. 

Are actions the result of a step-by-step planning process, or do actions occur in the context of a plan.

If language is considered an action, often (always) to interpret such language, more than the actual words has to be considered. Where does this "implied" knowledge come from. One idea is a shared knowledge and people seek to find their common overlap of shared knowledge to fill in the gaps. This is thought to be inaccurate.


"Rather than actions being determined by rules, actors effectively use the normative rules of conduct that are available to produce significant actions. So, for example, there is a normative rule for greetings that runs to the effect: do not initiate greetings except with persons who are acquaintances. If we witness a person greeting another who we know is not an acquaintance, we can either conclude that the greeter broke the rule or infer that via the use of the rule he or she was seeking to treat the other as an acquaintance. Such rules are not taught or encoded but are learned tacitly through typification over families of similar situations and actions."

"No action can fully provide for its own interpretation in any given instance. Instead, every instance of meaningful action must be accounted for separately with respect to specific, local, contingent determinants of significance."

"Instead of looking for a structure that is invariant across situations we look for the processes whereby particular, uniquely constituted circumstances are systematically interpreted so as to render meaning shared and action acountably rational."


"We have recognized that technology use is not a mechanical input-output relation between a person and a machine, that a much richer depiction of the user's situation is needed for design and evaluation."

Suchman argues that we don't really "interact" with machines because interaction requires a shared socioeconomic world. Basically when we interact with machines the way we interact with people, then we will have real human-computer interaction.

Vera and Simon argue that people employ Planning and planning execution. When things don't go according to plan, then they use situated action.

### Understanding Computers and Cognition

"We can create tools that are designed to make the maximal use of human perception and understanding without projecting human capacities on the computer."

Our current approach to AI will not result in "intelligent" machines.

Most AI today is just pattern matching.

* Breakdown: when unexpected things happen and the technology becomes visible. "A breakdown is not a negative situation to be avoided, but a situation of non-obviousness, in which the recognition that something is missing leads to unconcealing some aspect of the network of tools that we are engaged in using."
* Blindness: unexpect and unintended consequences of hiding or closing off possibilities or actions.
* Throwness: rarely is life based on preconceived actions, but instead life is thrown at us and we must act.

"The question 'Is X a bachelor?' cannot be answered without considering the potential answers to'Why do you want to know?'"
The appropriate action is dependant on context, i.e. the intended actions of the questioner.

"The essence of intelligence is to act appropriately when there is no simple pre-definition of the problem or the space of states in which to search for a solution."

"It should be no surprise then, that the area in which artificial intelligence has had the greatest difficulty is in the programming common sense."

"We accuse people of lacking common sense precisely when some representation of the sitaution has blinded them to a space of potentially relevant actions."

"the essence of our intelligence is in our thrownness, not our reflection."

"There is a clear split between the 'knowledge engineers,' who apply the well-developed technologies of AI to practical problems, and the 'mind-modelers,' who speculate about the more complex structures that might underlie human thought."

### The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction

##### The Model Human Processor

1. Perceptual system
  - Visual Image Store
  - Auditory Image Store
2. Motor system
3. Cognitive system
  - Working Memory  
    - Largely uses acoustic encoding. Hard to recall similar sounding chunks.
  - Longterm Memory
    - Largely uses semantic encoding. Hard to recall semantically similar chunks.
    - Fast reads
    - Slow writes
    - Infinite memory
    - Lookup happens through associations, and future assocations can obscure older connections.

Mental time decreases with repetitive tasks. 
A set of rules can predict where mental operations are needed.


### Cognition in the Wild

Where am I? — Tactics for answering this question while on the sea.

Makes me think a lot about AI tactics to predict the state of something, combining various sensors with the predicted state.

"crews of ship can function as a distributed machine, offloading the cognitive burden of ship navigation onto each member of the crew"

"The phrase "cognition in the wild" refers to human cognition in its natural habitat - that is, to naturally occurring culturally constituted human activity." - This makes me think of Event triggered surveys.

> This book is an attempt to put cognition back into the social and cultural world. In doing this I hope to show that human cognition is not just influenced by culture and society, but that it is in a very fundamental sense a cultural and social process. To do this I will move the boundaries of the cognitive unit of analysis out beyond the skin of the individual person and treat the navigation team as a cognitive and computational system.

> Chapter 1, "Welcome Aboard," attempts to locate the activity of ship navigation in the larger world of modern life. It weaves together three journeys: a movement through physical space from the "street" to the ship, a movement through social space from civilian to military life, and a movement through conceptual space from everyday notions of wayfinding to the technical domain of navigation. Both the researcher and the reader must make these journeys to arrive at the activity of navigation as practiced on the bridge of a Navy ship. Military ranks and the ways in which military identities are formed are presented here because these things affect individual's relationships to their work. An important aspect of the larger unit is that it contains computational elements (persons) who cannot be described entirely in computational terms. Who they talk to and how they talk to one another depend on these social organizational factors. This chapter also contains a discussion of the relationship of the researcher to the activity under study. (The name of the ship and the names of all the individuals mentioned in the book are pseudonyms. All the discourses reported, whether standing alone in transcript form or embedded in narrative passages were transcribed directly from audio recordings of actual events.)

> Having taken navigation as it is performed by a team on the bridge of a ship as the unit of cognitive analysis, I attempt in chapter 2, "Navigation as Computation," to apply the principal metaphor of cognitive science - cognition as computation - to the operation of this system. I should note here that in doing so, I do not make any special commitment to the nature of the computations that are going on inside individuals except to say that whatever happens there is part of a larger computational system. This chapter describes the application of David Marr's notions of levels of analysis of cognitive systems to the navigation task and shows that, at the computational level, it is possible to give a single description of the computational constraints of all known technical forms of human navigation. A comparison of modern Western navigation with navigation as practiced in Micronesia shows that considerable differences between these traditions lie at the representational/algorithmic level and at the implementational level. A brief historical review of the development of modern navigation shows that the representational and implementational details of contemporary practice are contingent on complex historical processes and that the accumulation of structure in the tools of the trade is itself a cognitive process.

### As We May Think 1945 (memex in 1939)

Director over Scientific Research for Roosevelt. Over 6000 scientists. Asked by Roosevelt how to apply "lessons learned" from World War II to peacetime problems.

"Bush expresses his concern for the direction of scientific efforts toward destruction, rather than understanding, and explicates a desire for a sort of collective memory machine with his concept of the memex that would make knowledge more accessible, believing that it would help fix these problems. Through this machine, Bush hoped to transform an information explosion into a knowledge explosion."

- How do we transition from war?
- "The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it."

- Forehead camera, with a trigger running down the arm sleeve, and a frame on the glasses showing what is in focus  — talks about it still using film, though. Didn't grasp that it would be digital, or wireless.
- Encyclopedia microfilm the size of matchboxes.
- Text-to-speech
- Programmable machines?
- Selection by association, not index.
- Memex: a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.
  - Drawer for microfilm storage
  - Two screens
  - Scanner
  - Levers for scrolling through a book.
  - Marginal notes
  - Linking items together (trails)
    - Can share trails with friends
  - Brain-Computer interfaces. 


### Making Sense of the Social World

Validity of Research
1. Valid Measurement
2. Generalizability
3. Causal Validity

- Inductive: Starting with data and pulling theories from it.
- Deductive Research: Starting with a theory and collecting data to test it.

- Independent Variable
- Dependent Variable

- Cross sectional study
- Trend study (multiple cross sections, longitudinal)
- Panel (multiple cross sections with the same people, longitudinal)

- Ecological fallacy: occurs when group-level data are used to draw conclusions about individual-level processes.
- Reductionist fallacy: reduces group behavior to that of individuals (reverse of Ecological fallacy)


- Ethics
- Sampling

Causal Validity
1. Assocation (Correlation)
2. Time order (did the change in the independent variable come before the change in the dependent variable)
3. Nonspuriousness (is there a third variable that actually affects the other two)
4. Mechanism (how does the independent variable affect the dependent variable)
5. Context (incentive pay with greater effort works in the US, but not in medieval Europe)

High and low scorers will naturally regress towards the mean. So when choosing a group based on pretest scores, beware of this natural regression.

Hawthorne effect: members of the treatment group change relative to the dependent variable because their participation in the study makes them feel special.
