I'm feeling stagnant. I have a lot of ideas. A lot of things that I'm involved in. An image of my future self. 

But I feel like I'm not progressing, and that I'm losing too many cycles context switching. I worry that the things that take my time are not what I want to be doing.

12 more months to get a PhD seems worth it.
